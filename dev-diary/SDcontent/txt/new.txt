Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity. Inspired by the Windows 95 era PowerToys project, this reboot provides power users with ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the Windows 10 shell and customize it for individual workflows. A great overview of the Windows 95 PowerToys can be found here.

Keyboard Manager
Keyboard Manager allows you to customize the keyboard to be more productive by remapping keys and creating your own keyboard shortcuts. This PowerToy requires Windows 10 1903 (build 18362) or later.




PowerRename
PowerRename is a Windows Shell Extension for advanced bulk renaming using search and replace or regular expressions. PowerRename allows simple search and replace or more advanced regular expression matching. While you type in the search and replace input fields, the preview area will show what the items will be renamed to.

One of the longer term goal items we have made progress on is the Out of Box experience / initial onboarding experience (OOBE) improvements.@Niels9001 created a wicked awesome proof of concept of what the OOBE experience could be. We are pretty stoked about this since it handles one an important item, critical shortcut default adjustments.

New experiential PowerToys utility - Video conference muting:
Note: This is only included in the pre-release version of PowerToys installer. This PowerToy requires Windows 10 1903 (build 18362) or later.

Back in the June timeframe, we started prototyping an idea. With COVID-19, we're all multi-tasking and trying to make the best of everything and being able to quickly mute while on a conference call is critical regardless of where you are on your computer and what application has focus.

The utility will mute not just your audio but your video as well with a single keystroke. You can do audio, video both. We knew this would impact our roadmap and goals but felt extremely strong that this is the right decision. We're all multi-tasking and trying to make the best of everything and being able to quickly mute while on a conference call is critical regardless of where you are on your computer.

We know we have some issues and we have a master tracking issue - #6246. We know a certain laptops currently the video forwarding does not work and are proactively working on fixing this.

To use:

Set your camera to the PowerToys Video driver in the target application
Win+N to toggle both Audio and Video at the same time
Win+Shift+O to toggle video
Win+Shift+A to toggle microphone
For a more information, head over to the Video conference mute overview

What is being planned for 0.23
For 0.23, we are proactively working on:

Stability
Localization
Improve interactions with elevated windows and keeping most of the PT utilities non-elevated so we still have a 'shell' like experience
OOBE work
PowerToys roadmap
Our prioritized roadmap of features and utilites that the core team is focusing on..
